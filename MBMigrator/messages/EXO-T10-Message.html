                We are excited to announce the Workspace Transformation and our journey to Microsoft 365. An essential
                step in this journey is to migrate your on-premises mailbox to Exchange Online. That means the contents
                of your mailboxes, conference rooms, calendars, and public folders will move to the Cloud.

            <td>
                Over the next few weeks, you will receive a series of messages related to your Outlook mailbox
                migration. These messages contain 'Need to Know' information to guide you through a good migration
                experience. You shouldn't notice anything different in Outlook, and there should be minimal disruption
                to your work.

                    <li>Our request &mdash; starting now, <strong>do not</strong> reorganize, clean-up, or make any
                        significant changes
                        to your mailbox folder structure.</li>
                    <li>You will receive an email next week with your Outlook migration date.</li>
                    <li>You will receive an email on the day of migration.</li>
                    <li>After your email migration is complete, the entire mailbox is moved; there will be no changes to
                        your folder structure and content.</li>
                </ul>
                We are working diligently to make this transition as smooth as possible, but we need your help!
