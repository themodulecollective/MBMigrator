                <p>You have been identified as having access to Company managed Microsoft Office
                    environment.
                    We are in the process of migrating to the Microsoft Office cloud solution, known as M365.
                    As part of this migration, we need to make a system change that will impact the way you access these
                    products.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Beginning {[ChangeDate]}, you will use your clientdomain primary email to login.</p>
                <p>You currently use {[UserPrincipalName]} today and will use {[PrimarySMTPAddress]} after the change.
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This email is being sent directly to all impacted parties. The clientdomain Client organization has
                    also
                    been notified.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Please disregard this message if you arenâ€™t leveraging the clientdomain managed Office 365
                    environment.
                </p>
