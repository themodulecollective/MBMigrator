                    receive an email stating "Your device is temporarily blocked from accessing content via Exchange
                    ActiveSync because the device has been quarantined." <strong>You do not need to take any
                        action.</strong> Access is granted automatically within a few minutes and email will begin
                    populating. Based on your cell signal/network connection, and amount of email and calendar events,
                    resyncing can take up to two hours.<br><br>
